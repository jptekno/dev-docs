# Reusable Snippets

Avoid repetition by creating reusable content snippets.

## Creating Snippets

Create a `snippets` folder and add MDX files:

```
your-docs/
├── snippets/
│   ├── prerequisites.mdx
│   ├── auth-warning.mdx
│   └── support-footer.mdx
└── guides/
    └── quickstart.mdx
```

## Snippet File

```mdx snippets/prerequisites.mdx
<Info>
  **Prerequisites**
  - Node.js v18 or higher
  - npm or yarn package manager
  - A DubStack account
</Info>
```

## Using Snippets

Import and use snippets in any MDX file:

```mdx guides/quickstart.mdx
---
title: "Quickstart"
---

import Prerequisites from '/snippets/prerequisites.mdx';

# Getting Started

<Prerequisites />

Now let's begin...
```

## Common Use Cases

  </Card>
  <Card title="Warnings" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Consistent warning messages

  <Card title="Code Examples" icon="code">
    Share common code patterns
  </Card>
  <Card title="Support CTAs" icon="headset">

## Best Practices

<Note>
  Keep snippets focused on a single piece of content. If a snippet is too large, consider making it a full page instead.
</Note>

- Name snippets descriptively
- Keep snippets small and focused
- Document what each snippet contains
- Update snippets in one place to update everywhere
