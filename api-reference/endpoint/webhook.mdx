# Webhooks

Webhooks allow you to receive real-time HTTP notifications when events occur in your account.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a webhook endpoint">
    Create an HTTP endpoint on your server to receive webhook events.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Register the webhook">
    Register your endpoint URL in your dashboard or via the API.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify signatures">
    Validate webhook signatures to ensure requests are from us.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Event Types

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `user.created` | A new user was created |
| `user.updated` | User information was updated |
| `user.deleted` | A user was deleted |
| `payment.completed` | Payment was successful |
| `payment.failed` | Payment failed |

## Payload Format

All webhooks follow this format:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123abc",
  "type": "user.created",
  "created": "2024-01-20T10:30:00Z",
  "data": {
    "id": "usr_456",
    "email": "new@example.com",
    "name": "New User"
  }
}
```

## Verifying Signatures

<CodeGroup>
```javascript Node.js
const crypto = require('crypto');

function verifyWebhook(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expected)
  );
}
```

```python Python
import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_webhook(payload, signature, secret):
    expected = hmac.new(
        secret.encode(),
        payload.encode(),
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()

    return hmac.compare_digest(signature, expected)
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Respond quickly">
    Return a 200 response as soon as possible. Process events asynchronously.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Handle retries">
    We retry failed deliveries up to 3 times with exponential backoff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use idempotency">
    Store event IDs to handle duplicate deliveries gracefully.
  </Accordion>
